# WeakAuras WotLK is out of Beta!

This release marks WeakAuras WotLK as officially released for Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a.

It all started with a simple goal: getting WeakAuras working for Awesome WotLK. Over a year of development and 500+ commits later, WeakAuras WotLK has reached roughly 97% parity with the modern WeakAuras2 codebase.

The remaining differences are mostly intentional WotLK compatibility work, unsupported Retail-era systems, and client-specific API limitations.

A big thank you to everyone who used the addon during the beta, reported bugs, opened issues, shared feedback, or helped others in the community.

Thank you all for being part of the journey.

<:WALurk:1341460510360604673> How a hidden WeakAuras bug survived almost four years

WeakAuras had a long-standing frame level issue introduced with nested groups in WA 4.0
On the WotLK client, frame levels are stored as a signed 8-bit integer, giving a safe range of 0-127
Frame levels are now derived from tree depth instead of being assigned sequentially
WeakAurasFrame can now live on FrameStrata MEDIUM without fighting Blizzard UI frames using SetTopLevel(true)
If elements need to render above or below others within the same group, FrameStrata should be adjusted explicitly
